# Zadanie-Testowe
If you want to check web site ( it's maybe be better that if you just double click on index.html ) you need to: 
1. Install Python 
2. Then in PowerShell ( Command Line ) print cd (path to project) example: d:\Projects\Test 
3. Then enter python -m http.server 8000 
4. Then enter to your Browser and follow the link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 
5. If you are ended browe back to Power Shell ( Command Line ) and press CTRL + C web site will shut down.
P.S: ( I just wanna say that adaptive for mobile doesn't work corect, becouse i try to understand how it's work in time when doing site)
